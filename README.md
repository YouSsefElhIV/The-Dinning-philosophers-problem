# Philosophers

Philosophers is a project that come from the famous " Dining philosophers problem", its about multiple philosophers each has one fork and in order to eat each needs 2 forks, therefore it is important to synchronize between them in order to feed them all if the time limit is favorable to do so. The philosophers is a representation of thread or process and the point of the project is to learn how to synchronize between them to create a functional program.
